<b> [THE 2014 GATHERING OF THE JUGGALOS DOCUMENTARY – DONATE HERE](http://www.gofundme.com/bkaxj4) </b>

The GOTJ is an annual music festival hosted by Psychopathic Records which spans 4 days and includes all kinds of events – music, wrestling matches, poker tournaments, ninja olympics, rap battles, tattoo contests, and more. It was held this year in Thorneville, OH from July 23 – July 27.

Previous documentaries have stripped the Juggalos of their humanity, portraying them as druggie criminals in clown make-up drinking Faygo. Why? We know that there is a greater story to be told.

Why do Juggalos come to the Gathering from all over America as well as the rest of the world? Where does their sense of community come from? What inspires people to come back year after year? When and why did they become Juggalos and Juggalettes?

These, and more, are the questions we will answer.
